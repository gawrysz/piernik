            ! OPT: Generally, the problem with load balance of particles in Piernik is hard, at least for current
            ! implmentation. Possible ways to consider:
            ! * Rearrange particle computations in a way that will allow for overlap with other costly operations.
            !   Personally, I don't have idea to what extent it is possible if at all.
            ! * Remove the concept of ghost particles. This should significantly reduce the amount of work associated
            !   with particles and thus will reduce the imbalance. For proper communication of the TSC map, one would
            !   need to write modified boundary exchange routines that would compute sums on overlapping boundary
            !   regions. Special care is needed on fine-coarse boundaries to correctly account for projecting TSC onto
            !   grid of different cell size.
            ! * Write a dedicated load balancing and offload whole "ghost cg" with particles to particle-deficient
            !   threads and communicate the density and potential fields. This may work nicely when the number of
            !   particles on a cg exceeds the number of its cells. For most dense particle clumps consider offloading
            !   only subsets of particles. The ratios or thresholds at which the offloading should occur has to be
            !   determined, but it may require relatively small changes to the code.
            ! * Exploit shared memory benefits and maintain the list of particles as a property of a host (set of
            !   threads) rather than property of a cg. Requires big chamges in the codebase. If MPI-3 would be used
            !   as a shared memory enabler, then it should be possible to perform the migration to shared  memory use
            !   in parts and start from the particles as most benefit is expected here. It is also possible to perform
            !   a conditional migration and enable the shared memory only when the code runs on a single host.
            !   This will be still quite beneficial for medium-sized runs, that may fit single machine.
            !   After validating single-machine shared memory code it may be relatively easy to go for general case as
            !   the inter-host communication would be analogous to what we have in Piernik now with the communication
            !   between threads. Using shared memory should be also beneficial for other parts of the code:
            !   * a lot of boundary exchanges could be performed as a direct memory copy,
            !   * some memory copies related to global reductions may be even avoided (e.g. in the multipole algorithm),
            !   * it is possible to achieve better cache utilisation by parallel processing of a single cg, which may
            !     also result in less transfers between CPU and RAM memory.
