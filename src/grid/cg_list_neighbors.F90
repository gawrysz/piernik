   !! \brief An abstract type created to take out neighbor finding code from cg_level
   !!
   !! \details
   !! OPT: Searching through this%dot%gse for neighbours, prolongation/restriction overlaps etc is quite costly.
   !! The cost is O(this%cnt^2). Provide a list, sorted according to Morton/Hilbert id's and do a bisection search
   !! instead of checking against all grids on AMR-style 'blocky' grids or cartesian decomposition with equal-sized
   !! grids. It will result in massive speedups on cg_list_neighbors_T%find_neighbors and
   !! cg_level_connected_T%{vertical_prep,vertical_b_prep). It may also simplify the process of fixing refinement
   !! structure in refinement_update::fix_refinement. Grids which are larger than AMR_bsize (merged grids, non-block
   !! decompositions, both not implemented yet) may be referred by several id's that correspond with AMR_bsize-d virtual
   !! grid pieces. Non-cartesian decompositions should be handled with the bruteforce way. It is possible to optimize
   !! them slightly if we save the numbers found during decomposition, but I don't think it is really important.
   !! Unequal cartesian decompositions should be handled with the bruteforce way. It can be optimized too, but the
   !! impact of optimization would be similar to optimization of non-cartesian decompositions.
   !! Alternatively, construct a searchable binary tree or oct-tree and provide fast routines for searching grid
   !! pieces covering specified position.

!! \brief Choose between more general and fast routine for neighbor searching
!!
!! \details
!!
!! Possible improvements of performance
!! * merge smaller blocks into larger ones,
!!
!! \todo Write variant of find_neighbors_* routine to achieve previous (pre-a27c945a) performance and maintain
!! correctness on corners on complicated topologies:
!! * Divide the descriptions of communicated regions into 4 categories: X-faces, Y-faces + XY-corners, Z-faces +
!!   [XY]Z-corners, other corners. The other corners would be non-empty only for some refinement local topologies,
!!   it would certainly be empty on an uniform grid.
!! * When no corners are required, perform simultaneous exchange described by the three directional categories.
!!   Some corners might be set up correctly by a chance, some might not.
!! * When corners are required, perform sequential exchange described by the three directional categories and
!!   supplement it with communication of "other corners". The sequence of Isend/Irecv should be as follows: Isend
!!   X-faces, Irecv X-faces, Waitall, Isend Y-faces, Irecv Y-faces, Waitall, Isend Z-faces, Irecv Z-faces, Waitall
!!   "Other corners" can be Isend at any time and must be Irecv after Z-faces are copied to the right place.

!! \brief Make full description of intra-level communication with neighbors. Approach exploiting strict SFC
!! distribution.
!!
!! \details Assume that cuboids don't collide (no overlapping grid pieces on same refinement level are allowed)
!! Should produce the same set of blocks to be communicated as find_neighbors_bruteforce, but should be way faster,
!! especially in massively parallel runs.
!!
!! This approach works best if the grid containers are distributing strictly according to the SFC curve and are sorted.
!! If each of p processes has g grid containers on current level (giving n = p * g grids on the level),
!! the cost should be proportional to (log_2(p)+log_2(g))*g, assuming that we have already sorted array
!! containing most critical information from this%dot%gse
!!
!! OPT: there is an easy way to determine here if the corner updates can be performed by face updates done in a
!! sequence of "sweeps" or not. It is possible even to isolate only those corners that can't be updated with face
!! communication. The question is: will it really matter for AMR communication, when we manage to aggregate separate
!! messages for pairs of processes to a single message? IMO not that much.
!!
!! OPT: To achieve pre-a27c945a performance in uniform-grid simulations we may also implement another variant of
!! find_neighbors_* that looks only for face neighbors (typically 6, in worst case 12, still far less than 26) for
!! levels that are fully covered (or even for levels that are covered by strictly convect, well separated groups of
!! grids).

!! \brief Make full description of intra-level communication with neighbors. Brute-force approach.
!!
!! \details Assume that cuboids don't collide (no overlapping grid pieces on same refinement level are allowed)
!!
!! This is very general but also quite slow approach. If each of p processes has g grid containers on current level
!! (giving n = p * g grids on the level), the cost is proportional to p*p*g or n*n/p.
!!
!! Current implementation (commit a27c945a) implies correct update of all corners, even on complicated refinement
!! topologies (concave fine region - convect coarse region or fine regions touching each other only by corners).
!! Previous implementation could correctly fill the corners only on an uniform grid and when boundary exchange was
!! called for x, y and z directions separately. Warning: that change introduces measurable performance degradation!
!! This is caused by the fact that in 3D it is required to make 26 separate exchanges to fill all guardcells (in
!! cg_list_bnd::internal_boundaries), while in previous approach only 6 exchanges were required. Unfortunately
!! the previous approach did not work properly for complicated refinements.
!!
!! \todo consider going back to sweeped boundary exchanges (only 6 neighbours to communicate with) as soon as
!! find_neighbors_SFC is tested enough to be chosen as the only option for AMR 'blocky' grids.

      !! * more for AMR with consolidated blocks (unimplemented yet, not compatible with current approach)
