 Based on the literature cited in info:
 
 The analytic solutions can be considered as generalized configurations of 
 Maclaurin spheroids, and of Dedekind ellipsoids. 

 Generalized Jacobi and Riemann's S-type ellipsoids are not included
 in the current solutions. 

 Rotation is expected to stabilise the figure provided the rotational
 angular frequency is greater than the Alfv{\'e}n frequency
